       "'I had always thought Jack Gisburn rather a cheap genius--though a\\n\\ngood fellow enough--so it was no great surprise to me to hear\\n\\nthat, in the height of his glory, he had dropped his painting,\\n\\nmarried a rich widow, and established himself in a villa on the\\n\\nRiviera. (Though I rather thought it would have been Rome or\\n\\nFlorence.)\\n\\n\"The height of his glory\"--that was what the women called it. I\\n\\ncan hear Mrs. Gideon Thwing--his last Chicago sitter--deploring\\n\\nhis unaccountable abdication. \"Of course it\\'s going to send the\\n\\nvalue of my picture \\'way up; but I don\\'t think of that, Mr.\\n\\nRickham--the loss to Arrt is all I think of.\" The word, on Mrs.\\n\\nThwing\\'s lips, multiplied its RS as though they were reflected in\\n\\nan endless vista of mirrors. And it was not only the Mrs. Thwings\\n\\nwho mourned. Had not the exquisite Hermia Croft, at the last\\n\\nGrafton Gallery show, stopped me before Gisburn\\'s \"Moon-dancers\"\\n\\nto say, with tears in her eyes: \"We shall not look upon\\n\\nits like again\"?\\n\\nWell!--even through the prism of Hermia\\'s tears I felt able to\\n\\nface the fact with equanimity. Poor Jack Gisburn! The women had\\n\\nmade him--it was fitting that they should mourn him. Among his\\n\\nown sex fewer regrets were heard, and in his own trade hardly a\\n\\nmurmur. Professional jealousy? Perhaps. If it were, the honour\\n\\nof the craft was vindicated by little Claude Nutley, who, in all\\n\\ngood faith, brought out in the Burlington a very handsome\\n\\n\"obituary\" on Jack--one of those showy articles stocked with\\n\\nrandom technicalities that I have heard (I won\\'t say by whom)\\n\\ncompared to Gisburn\\'s painting. And so--his resolve being\\n\\napparently irrevocable--the discussion gradually died out, and,\\n\\nas Mrs. Thwing had predicted, the price of \"Gisburns\" went up.\\n\\nIt was not till three years later that, in the course of a few\\n\\nweeks\\' idling on the Riviera, it suddenly occurred to me to\\n\\nwonder why Gisburn had given up his painting. On reflection, it\\n\\nreally was a tempting problem. To accuse his wife would have\\n\\nbeen too easy--his fair sitters had been denied the solace of\\n\\nsaying that Mrs. Gisburn had \"dragged him down.\" For Mrs.\\n\\nGisburn--as such--had not existed till nearly a year after Jack\\'s\\n\\nresolve had been taken. It might be that he had married her--\\n\\nsince he liked his ease--because he didn\\'t want to go on\\n\\npainting; but it would have been hard to prove that he had given\\n\\nup his painting because he had married her.\\n\\nOf course, if she had not dragged him down, she had equally, as\\n\\nMiss Croft contended, failed to \"lift him up\"--she had not led\\n\\nhim back to the easel. To put the brush into his hand again--\\n\\nwhat a vocation for a wife! But Mrs. Gisburn appeared to have\\n\\ndisdained it--and I felt it might be interesting to find out why.\\n\\nThe desultory life of the Riviera lends itself to such purely\\n\\nacademic speculations; and having, on my way to Monte Carlo,\\n\\ncaught a glimpse of Jack\\'s balustraded terraces between the\\n\\npines, I had myself borne thither the next day.\\n\\nI found the couple at tea beneath their palm-trees; and Mrs.\\n\\nGisburn\\'s welcome was so genial that, in the ensuing weeks, I\\n\\nclaimed it frequently. It was not that my hostess was\\n\\n\"interesting\": on that point I could have given Miss Croft the\\n\\nfullest reassurance. It was just because she was NOT\\n\\ninteresting--if I may be pardoned the bull--that I found her so.\\n\\nFor Jack, all his life, had been surrounded by interesting women:\\n\\nthey had fostered his art, it had been reared in the hot-house of\\n\\ntheir adulation. And it was therefore instructive to note what\\n\\neffect the \"deadening atmosphere of mediocrity\" (I quote Miss\\n\\nCroft) was having on him.\\n\\nI have mentioned that Mrs. Gisburn was rich; and it was\\n\\nimmediately perceptible that her husband was extracting from this\\n\\ncircumstance a delicate but substantial satisfaction. It is, as\\n\\na rule, the people who scorn money who get most out of it; and\\n\\nJack\\'s elegant disdain of his wife\\'s big balance enabled him,\\n\\nwith an appearance of perfect good-breeding, to transmute it into\\n\\nobjects of art and luxury. To the latter, I must add, he\\n\\nremained relatively indifferent; but he was buying Renaissance\\n\\nbronzes and eighteenth-century pictures with a discrimination\\n\\nthat bespoke the amplest resources.\\n\\n\"Money\\'s only excuse is to put beauty into circulation,\" was one\\n\\nof the axioms he laid down across the Sevres and silver of an\\n\\nexquisitely appointed luncheon-table, when, on a later day, I had\\n\\nagain run over from Monte Carlo; and Mrs. Gisburn, beaming on\\n\\nhim, added for my enlightenment: \"Jack is so morbidly sensitive\\n\\nto every form of beauty.\"\\n\\nPoor Jack! It had always been his fate to have women say such\\n\\nthings of him: the fact should be set down in extenuation. What\\n\\nstruck me now was that, for the first time, he resented the tone.\\n\\nI had seen him, so often, basking under similar tributes--was it\\n\\nthe conjugal note that robbed them of their savour? No--for,\\n\\noddly enough, it became apparent that he was fond of Mrs.\\n\\nGisburn--fond enough not to see her absurdity. It was his own\\n\\nabsurdity he seemed to be wincing under--his own attitude as an\\n\\nobject for garlands and incense.\\n\\n\"My dear, since I\\'ve chucked painting people don\\'t say that stuff\\n\\nabout me--they say it about Victor Grindle,\" was his only\\n\\nprotest, as he rose from the table and strolled out onto the\\n\\nsunlit terrace.\\n\\nI glanced after him, struck by his last word. Victor Grindle\\n\\nwas, in fact, becoming the man of the moment--as Jack himself,\\n\\none might put it, had been the man of the hour. The younger\\n\\nartist was said to have formed himself at my friend\\'s feet, and I\\n\\nwondered if a tinge of jealousy underlay the latter\\'s mysterious\\n\\nabdication. But no--for it was not till after that event that\\n\\nthe rose Dubarry drawing-rooms had begun to display their\\n\\n\"Grindles.\"\\n\\nI turned to Mrs. Gisburn, who had lingered to give a lump of\\n\\nsugar to her spaniel in the dining-room.\\n\\n\"Why HAS he chucked painting?\" I asked abruptly.\\n\\nShe raised her eyebrows with a hint of good-humoured surprise.\\n\\n\"Oh, he doesn\\'t HAVE to now, you know; and I want him to enjoy\\n\\nhimself,\" she said quite simply.\\n\\nI looked about the spacious white-panelled room, with its\\n\\nfamille-verte vases repeating the tones of the pale damask\\n\\ncurtains, and its eighteenth-century pastels in delicate faded\\n\\nframes.\\n\\n\"Has he chucked his pictures too? I haven\\'t seen a single one in\\n\\nthe house.\"\\n\\nA slight shade of constraint crossed Mrs. Gisburn\\'s open\\n\\ncountenance. \"It\\'s his ridiculous modesty, you know. He says\\n\\nthey\\'re not fit to have about; he\\'s sent them all away except\\n\\none--my portrait--and that I have to keep upstairs.\"\\n\\nHis ridiculous modesty--Jack\\'s modesty about his pictures? My\\n\\ncuriosity was growing like the bean-stalk. I said persuasively\\n\\nto my hostess: \"I must really see your portrait, you know.\"\\n\\nShe glanced out almost timorously at the terrace where her\\n\\nhusband, lounging in a hooded chair, had lit a cigar and drawn\\n\\nthe Russian deerhound\\'s head between his knees.\\n\\n\"Well, come while he\\'s not looking,\" she said, with a laugh that\\n\\ntried to hide her nervousness; and I followed her between the\\n\\nmarble Emperors of the hall, and up the wide stairs with terra-\\n\\ncotta nymphs poised among flowers at each landing.\\n\\nIn the dimmest corner of her boudoir, amid a profusion of\\n\\ndelicate and distinguished objects, hung one of the familiar oval\\n\\ncanvases, in the inevitable garlanded frame. The mere outline of\\n\\nthe frame called up all Gisburn\\'s past!\\n\\nMrs. Gisburn drew back the window-curtains, moved aside a\\n\\njardiniere full of pink azaleas, pushed an arm-chair away, and\\n\\nsaid: \"If you stand here you can just manage to see it. I had it\\n\\nover the mantel-piece, but he wouldn\\'t let it stay.\"\\n\\nYes--I could just manage to see it--the first portrait of Jack\\'s\\n\\nI had ever had to strain my eyes over! Usually they had the\\n\\nplace of honour--say the central panel in a pale yellow or rose\\n\\nDubarry drawing-room, or a monumental easel placed so that it\\n\\ntook the light through curtains of old Venetian point. The more\\n\\nmodest place became the picture better; yet, as my eyes grew\\n\\naccustomed to the half-light, all the characteristic qualities\\n\\ncame out--all the hesitations disguised as audacities, the tricks\\n\\nof prestidigitation by which, with such consummate skill, he\\n\\nmanaged to divert attention from the real business of the picture\\n\\nto some pretty irrelevance of detail. Mrs. Gisburn, presenting a\\n\\nneutral surface to work on--forming, as it were, so inevitably\\n\\nthe background of her own picture--had lent herself in an unusual\\n\\ndegree to the display of this false virtuosity. The picture was\\n\\none of Jack\\'s \"strongest,\" as his admirers would have put it--it\\n\\nrepresented, on his part, a swelling of muscles, a congesting of\\n\\nveins, a balancing, straddling and straining, that reminded one\\n\\nof the circus-clown\\'s ironic efforts to lift a feather. It met,\\n\\nin short, at every point the demand of lovely woman to be painted\\n\\n\"strongly\" because she was tired of being painted \"sweetly\"--and\\n\\nyet not to lose an atom of the sweetness.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the last he painted, you know,\" Mrs. Gisburn said with\\n\\npardonable pride. \"The last but one,\" she corrected herself--\\n\\n\"but the other doesn\\'t count, because he destroyed it.\"\\n\\n\"Destroyed it?\" I was about to follow up this clue when I heard\\n\\na footstep and saw Jack himself on the threshold.\\n\\nAs he stood there, his hands in the pockets of his velveteen\\n\\ncoat, the thin brown waves of hair pushed back from his white\\n\\nforehead, his lean sunburnt cheeks furrowed by a smile that\\n\\nlifted the tips of a self-confident moustache, I felt to what a\\n\\ndegree he had the same quality as his pictures--the quality of\\n\\nlooking cleverer than he was.\\n\\nHis wife glanced at him deprecatingly, but his eyes travelled\\n\\npast her to the portrait.\\n\\n\"Mr. Rickham wanted to see it,\" she began, as if excusing\\n\\nherself. He shrugged his shoulders, still smiling.\\n\\n\"Oh, Rickham found me out long ago,\" he said lightly; then,\\n\\npassing his arm through mine: \"Come and see the rest of the\\n\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nHe showed it to me with a kind of naive suburban pride: the\\n\\nbath-rooms, the speaking-tubes, the dress-closets, the trouser-\\n\\npresses--all the complex simplifications of the millionaire\\'s\\n\\ndomestic economy. And whenever my wonder paid the expected\\n\\ntribute he said, throwing out his chest a little: \"Yes, I really\\n\\ndon\\'t see how people manage to live without that.\"\\n\\nWell--it was just the end one might have foreseen for him. Only\\n\\nhe was, through it all and in spite of it all--as he had been\\n\\nthrough, and in spite of, his pictures--so handsome, so charming,\\n\\nso disarming, that one longed to cry out: \"Be dissatisfied with\\n\\nyour leisure!\" as once one had longed to say: \"Be dissatisfied\\n\\nwith your work!\"\\n\\nBut, with the cry on my lips, my diagnosis suffered an unexpected\\n\\ncheck.\\n\\n\"This is my own lair,\" he said, leading me into a dark plain room\\n\\nat the end of the florid vista. It was square and brown and\\n\\nleathery: no \"effects\"; no bric-a-brac, none of the air of posing\\n\\nfor reproduction in a picture weekly--above all, no least sign of\\n\\never having been used as a studio.\\n\\nThe fact brought home to me the absolute finality of Jack\\'s break\\n\\nwith his old life.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you ever dabble with paint any more?\" I asked, still\\n\\nlooking about for a trace of such activity.\\n\\n\"Never,\" he said briefly.\\n\\n\"Or water-colour--or etching?\"\\n\\nHis confident eyes grew dim, and his cheeks paled a little under\\n\\ntheir handsome sunburn.\\n\\n\"Never think of it, my dear fellow--any more than if I\\'d never\\n\\ntouched a brush.\"\\n\\nAnd his tone told me in a flash that he never thought of anything\\n\\nelse.\\n\\nI moved away, instinctively embarrassed by my unexpected\\n\\ndiscovery; and as I turned, my eye fell on a small picture above\\n\\nthe mantel-piece--the only object breaking the plain oak\\n\\npanelling of the room.\\n\\n\"Oh, by Jove!\" I said.\\n\\nIt was a sketch of a donkey--an old tired donkey, standing in the\\n\\nrain under a wall.\\n\\n\"By Jove--a Stroud!\" I cried.\\n\\nHe was silent; but I felt him close behind me, breathing a little\\n\\nquickly.\\n\\n\"What a wonder! Made with a dozen lines--but on everlasting\\n\\nfoundations. You lucky chap, where did you get it?\"\\n\\nHe answered slowly: \"Mrs. Stroud gave it to me.\"\\n\\n\"Ah--I didn\\'t know you even knew the Strouds. He was such an\\n\\ninflexible hermit.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t--till after. . . . She sent for me to paint him when\\n\\nhe was dead.\"\\n\\n\"When he was dead? You?\"\\n\\nI must have let a little too much amazement escape through my\\n\\nsurprise, for he answered with a deprecating laugh: \"Yes--she\\'s\\n\\nan awful simpleton, you know, Mrs. Stroud. Her only idea was to\\n\\nhave him done by a fashionable painter--ah, poor Stroud! She\\n\\nthought it the surest way of proclaiming his greatness--of\\n\\nforcing it on a purblind public. And at the moment I was THE\\n\\nfashionable painter.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, poor Stroud--as you say. Was THAT his history?\"\\n\\n\"That was his history. She believed in him, gloried in him--or\\n\\nthought she did. But she couldn\\'t bear not to have all the\\n\\ndrawing-rooms with her. She couldn\\'t bear the fact that, on\\n\\nvarnishing days, one could always get near enough to see his\\n\\npictures. Poor woman! She\\'s just a fragment groping for other\\n\\nfragments. Stroud is the only whole I ever knew.\"\\n\\n\"You ever knew? But you just said--\"\\n\\nGisburn had a curious smile in his eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, I knew him, and he knew me--only it happened after he was\\n\\ndead.\"\\n\\nI dropped my voice instinctively. \"When she sent for you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--quite insensible to the irony. She wanted him vindicated--\\n\\nand by me!\"\\n\\nHe laughed again, and threw back his head to look up at the\\n\\nsketch of the donkey. \"There were days when I couldn\\'t look at\\n\\nthat thing--couldn\\'t face it. But I forced myself to put it\\n\\nhere; and now it\\'s cured me--cured me. That\\'s the reason why I\\n\\ndon\\'t dabble any more, my dear Rickham; or rather Stroud himself\\n\\nis the reason.\"\\n\\nFor the first time my idle curiosity about my companion turned\\n\\ninto a serious desire to understand him better.\\n\\n\"I wish you\\'d tell me how it happened,\" I said.\\n\\nHe stood looking up at the sketch, and twirling between his\\n\\nfingers a cigarette he had forgotten to light. Suddenly he\\n\\nturned toward me.\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather like to tell you--because I\\'ve always suspected you\\n\\nof loathing my work.\"\\n\\nI made a deprecating gesture, which he negatived with a good-\\n\\nhumoured shrug.\\n\\n\"Oh, I didn\\'t care a straw when I believed in myself--and now\\n\\nit\\'s an added tie between us!\"\\n\\nHe laughed slightly, without bitterness, and pushed one of the\\n\\ndeep arm-chairs forward. \"There: make yourself comfortable--and\\n\\nhere are the cigars you like.\"\\n\\nHe placed them at my elbow and continued to wander up and down\\n\\nthe room, stopping now and then beneath the picture.\\n\\n\"How it happened? I can tell you in five minutes--and it didn\\'t\\n\\ntake much longer to happen. . . . I can remember now how\\n\\nsurprised and pleased I was when I got Mrs. Stroud\\'s note. Of\\n\\ncourse, deep down, I had always FELT there was no one like him--\\n\\nonly I had gone with the stream, echoed the usual platitudes\\n\\nabout him, till I half got to think he was a failure, one of the\\n\\nkind that are left behind. By Jove, and he WAS left behind--\\n\\nbecause he had come to stay! The rest of us had to let ourselves\\n\\nbe swept along or go under, but he was high above the current--on\\n\\neverlasting foundations, as you say.\\n\\n\"Well, I went off to the house in my most egregious mood--rather\\n\\nmoved, Lord forgive me, at the pathos of poor Stroud\\'s career of\\n\\nfailure being crowned by the glory of my painting him! Of course\\n\\nI meant to do the picture for nothing--I told Mrs. Stroud so when\\n\\nshe began to stammer something about her poverty. I remember\\n\\ngetting off a prodigious phrase about the honour being MINE--oh,\\n\\nI was princely, my dear Rickham! I was posing to myself like one\\n\\nof my own sitters.\\n\\n\"Then I was taken up and left alone with him. I had sent all my\\n\\ntraps in advance, and I had only to set up the easel and get to\\n\\nwork. He had been dead only twenty-four hours, and he died\\n\\nsuddenly, of heart disease, so that there had been no preliminary\\n\\nwork of destruction--his face was clear and untouched. I had met\\n\\nhim once or twice, years before, and thought him insignificant\\n\\nand dingy. Now I saw that he was superb.\\n\\n\"I was glad at first, with a merely aesthetic satisfaction: glad\\n\\nto have my hand on such a \\'subject.\\' Then his strange life-\\n\\nlikeness began to affect me queerly--as I blocked the head in I\\n\\nfelt as if he were watching me do it. The sensation was followed\\n\\nby the thought: if he WERE watching me, what would he say to my\\n\\nway of working? My strokes began to go a little wild--I felt\\n\\nnervous and uncertain.\\n\\n\"Once, when I looked up, I seemed to see a smile behind his close\\n\\ngrayish beard--as if he had the secret, and were amusing himself\\n\\nby holding it back from me. That exasperated me still more. The\\n\\nsecret? Why, I had a secret worth twenty of his! I dashed at\\n\\nthe canvas furiously, and tried some of my bravura tricks. But\\n\\nthey failed me, they crumbled. I saw that he wasn\\'t watching the\\n\\nshowy bits--I couldn\\'t distract his attention; he just kept his\\n\\neyes on the hard passages between. Those were the ones I had\\n\\nalways shirked, or covered up with some lying paint. And how he\\n\\nsaw through my lies!\\n\\n\"I looked up again, and caught sight of that sketch of the donkey\\n\\nhanging on the wall near his bed. His wife told me afterward it\\n\\nwas the last thing he had done--just a note taken with a shaking\\n\\nhand, when he was down in Devonshire recovering from a previous\\n\\nheart attack. Just a note! But it tells his whole history.\\n\\nThere are years of patient scornful persistence in every line. A\\n\\nman who had swum with the current could never have learned that\\n\\nmighty up-stream stroke. . . .\\n\\n\"I turned back to my work, and went on groping and muddling; then\\n\\nI looked at the donkey again. I saw that, when Stroud laid in\\n\\nthe first stroke, he knew just what the end would be. He had\\n\\npossessed his subject, absorbed it, recreated it. When had I\\n\\ndone that with any of my things? They hadn\\'t been born of me--I\\n\\nhad just adopted them. . . .\\n\\n\"Hang it, Rickham, with that face watching me I couldn\\'t do\\n\\nanother stroke. The plain truth was, I didn\\'t know where to put\\n\\nit--I HAD NEVER KNOWN. Only, with my sitters and my public, a\\n\\nshowy splash of colour covered up the fact--I just threw paint\\n\\ninto their faces. . . . Well, paint was the one medium those\\n\\ndead eyes could see through--see straight to the tottering\\n\\nfoundations underneath. Don\\'t you know how, in talking a foreign\\n\\nlanguage, even fluently, one says half the time not what one\\n\\nwants to but what one can? Well--that was the way I painted; and\\n\\nas he lay there and watched me, the thing they called my\\n\\n\\'technique\\' collapsed like a house of cards. He didn\\'t sneer,\\n\\nyou understand, poor Stroud--he just lay there quietly watching,\\n\\nand on his lips, through the gray beard, I seemed to hear the\\n\\nquestion: \\'Are you sure you know where you\\'re coming out?\\'\\n\\n\"If I could have painted that face, with that question on it, I\\n\\nshould have done a great thing. The next greatest thing was to\\n\\nsee that I couldn\\'t--and that grace was given me. But, oh, at\\n\\nthat minute, Rickham, was there anything on earth I wouldn\\'t have\\n\\ngiven to have Stroud alive before me, and to hear him say: \\'It\\'s\\n\\nnot too late--I\\'ll show you how\\'?\\n\\n\"It WAS too late--it would have been, even if he\\'d been alive. I\\n\\npacked up my traps, and went down and told Mrs. Stroud. Of\\n\\ncourse I didn\\'t tell her THAT--it would have been Greek to her.\\n\\nI simply said I couldn\\'t paint him, that I was too moved. She\\n\\nrather liked the idea--she\\'s so romantic! It was that that made\\n\\nher give me the donkey. But she was terribly upset at not\\n\\ngetting the portrait--she did so want him \\'done\\' by some one\\n\\nshowy! At first I was afraid she wouldn\\'t let me off--and at my\\n\\nwits\\' end I suggested Grindle. Yes, it was I who started\\n\\nGrindle: I told Mrs. Stroud he was the \\'coming\\' man, and she told\\n\\nsomebody else, and so it got to be true. . . . And he painted\\n\\nStroud without wincing; and she hung the picture among her\\n\\nhusband\\'s things. . . .\"\\n\\nHe flung himself down in the arm-chair near mine, laid back his\\n\\nhead, and clasping his arms beneath it, looked up at the picture\\n\\nabove the chimney-piece.\\n\\n\"I like to fancy that Stroud himself would have given it to me,\\n\\nif he\\'d been able to say what he thought that day.\"\\n\\nAnd, in answer to a question I put half-mechanically--\"Begin\\n\\nagain?\" he flashed out. \"When the one thing that brings me\\n\\nanywhere near him is that I knew enough to leave off?\"\\n\\nHe stood up and laid his hand on my shoulder with a laugh. \"Only\\n\\nthe irony of it is that I AM still painting--since Grindle\\'s\\n\\ndoing it for me! The Strouds stand alone, and happen once--but\\n\\nthere\\'s no exterminating our kind of art.\"\\n\\nThe End of The Verdict'"

       "'married a rich widow, and established himself in a villa on the\\n\\nRiviera. (Though I rather thought it would have been Rome or\\n\\nFlorence.)\\n\\n\"The height of his glory\"--that was what the women called it. I\\n\\ncan hear Mrs. Gideon Thwing--his last Chicago sitter--deploring\\n\\nhis unaccountable abdication. \"Of course it\\'s going to send the\\n\\nvalue of my picture \\'way up; but I don\\'t think of that, Mr.\\n\\nRickham--the loss to Arrt is all I think of.\" The word, on Mrs.\\n\\nThwing\\'s lips, multiplied its RS as though they were reflected in\\n\\nan endless vista of mirrors. And it was not only the Mrs. Thwings\\n\\nwho mourned. Had not the exquisite Hermia Croft, at the last\\n\\nGrafton Gallery show, stopped me before Gisburn\\'s \"Moon-dancers\"\\n\\nto say, with tears in her eyes: \"We shall not look upon\\n\\nits like again\"?\\n\\nWell!--even through the prism of Hermia\\'s tears I felt able to\\n\\nface the fact with equanimity. Poor Jack Gisburn! The women had\\n\\nmade him--it was fitting that they should mourn him. Among his\\n\\nown sex fewer regrets were heard, and in his own trade hardly a\\n\\nmurmur. Professional jealousy? Perhaps. If it were, the honour\\n\\nof the craft was vindicated by little Claude Nutley, who, in all\\n\\ngood faith, brought out in the Burlington a very handsome\\n\\n\"obituary\" on Jack--one of those showy articles stocked with\\n\\nrandom technicalities that I have heard (I won\\'t say by whom)\\n\\ncompared to Gisburn\\'s painting. And so--his resolve being\\n\\napparently irrevocable--the discussion gradually died out, and,\\n\\nas Mrs. Thwing had predicted, the price of \"Gisburns\" went up.\\n\\nIt was not till three years later that, in the course of a few\\n\\nweeks\\' idling on the Riviera, it suddenly occurred to me to\\n\\nwonder why Gisburn had given up his painting. On reflection, it\\n\\nreally was a tempting problem. To accuse his wife would have\\n\\nbeen too easy--his fair sitters had been denied the solace of\\n\\nsaying that Mrs. Gisburn had \"dragged him down.\" For Mrs.\\n\\nGisburn--as such--had not existed till nearly a year after Jack\\'s\\n\\nresolve had been taken. It might be that he had married her--\\n\\nsince he liked his ease--because he didn\\'t want to go on\\n\\npainting; but it would have been hard to prove that he had given\\n\\nup his painting because he had married her.\\n\\nOf course, if she had not dragged him down, she had equally, as\\n\\nMiss Croft contended, failed to \"lift him up\"--she had not led\\n\\nhim back to the easel. To put the brush into his hand again--\\n\\nwhat a vocation for a wife! But Mrs. Gisburn appeared to have\\n\\ndisdained it--and I felt it might be interesting to find out why.\\n\\nThe desultory life of the Riviera lends itself to such purely\\n\\nacademic speculations; and having, on my way to Monte Carlo,\\n\\ncaught a glimpse of Jack\\'s balustraded terraces between the\\n\\npines, I had myself borne thither the next day.\\n\\nI found the couple at tea beneath their palm-trees; and Mrs.\\n\\nGisburn\\'s welcome was so genial that, in the ensuing weeks, I\\n\\nclaimed it frequently. It was not that my hostess was\\n\\n\"interesting\": on that point I could have given Miss Croft the\\n\\nfullest reassurance. It was just because she was NOT\\n\\ninteresting--if I may be pardoned the bull--that I found her so.\\n\\nFor Jack, all his life, had been surrounded by interesting women:\\n\\nthey had fostered his art, it had been reared in the hot-house of\\n\\ntheir adulation. And it was therefore instructive to note what\\n\\neffect the \"deadening atmosphere of mediocrity\" (I quote Miss\\n\\nCroft) was having on him.\\n\\nI have mentioned that Mrs. Gisburn was rich; and it was\\n\\nimmediately perceptible that her husband was extracting from this\\n\\ncircumstance a delicate but substantial satisfaction. It is, as\\n\\na rule, the people who scorn money who get most out of it; and\\n\\nJack\\'s elegant disdain of his wife\\'s big balance enabled him,\\n\\nwith an appearance of perfect good-breeding, to transmute it into\\n\\nobjects of art and luxury. To the latter, I must add, he\\n\\nremained relatively indifferent; but he was buying Renaissance\\n\\nbronzes and eighteenth-century pictures with a discrimination\\n\\nthat bespoke the amplest resources.\\n\\n\"Money\\'s only excuse is to put beauty into circulation,\" was one\\n\\nof the axioms he laid down across the Sevres and silver of an\\n\\nexquisitely appointed luncheon-table, when, on a later day, I had\\n\\nagain run over from Monte Carlo; and Mrs. Gisburn, beaming on\\n\\nhim, added for my enlightenment: \"Jack is so morbidly sensitive\\n\\nto every form of beauty.\"\\n\\nPoor Jack! It had always been his fate to have women say such\\n\\nthings of him: the fact should be set down in extenuation. What\\n\\nstruck me now was that, for the first time, he resented the tone.\\n\\nI had seen him, so often, basking under similar tributes--was it\\n\\nthe conjugal note that robbed them of their savour? No--for,\\n\\noddly enough, it became apparent that he was fond of Mrs.\\n\\nGisburn--fond enough not to see her absurdity. It was his own\\n\\nabsurdity he seemed to be wincing under--his own attitude as an\\n\\nobject for garlands and incense.\\n\\n\"My dear, since I\\'ve chucked painting people don\\'t say that stuff\\n\\nabout me--they say it about Victor Grindle,\" was his only\\n\\nprotest, as he rose from the table and strolled out onto the\\n\\nsunlit terrace.\\n\\nI glanced after him, struck by his last word. Victor Grindle\\n\\nwas, in fact, becoming the man of the moment--as Jack himself,\\n\\none might put it, had been the man of the hour. The younger\\n\\nartist was said to have formed himself at my friend\\'s feet, and I\\n\\nwondered if a tinge of jealousy underlay the latter\\'s mysterious\\n\\nabdication. But no--for it was not till after that event that\\n\\nthe rose Dubarry drawing-rooms had begun to display their\\n\\n\"Grindles.\"\\n\\nI turned to Mrs. Gisburn, who had lingered to give a lump of\\n\\nsugar to her spaniel in the dining-room.\\n\\n\"Why HAS he chucked painting?\" I asked abruptly.\\n\\nShe raised her eyebrows with a hint of good-humoured surprise.\\n\\n\"Oh, he doesn\\'t HAVE to now, you know; and I want him to enjoy\\n\\nhimself,\" she said quite simply.\\n\\nI looked about the spacious white-panelled room, with its\\n\\nfamille-verte vases repeating the tones of the pale damask\\n\\ncurtains, and its eighteenth-century pastels in delicate faded\\n\\nframes.\\n\\n\"Has he chucked his pictures too? I haven\\'t seen a single one in\\n\\nthe house.\"\\n\\nA slight shade of constraint crossed Mrs. Gisburn\\'s open\\n\\ncountenance. \"It\\'s his ridiculous modesty, you know. He says\\n\\nthey\\'re not fit to have about; he\\'s sent them all away except\\n\\none--my portrait--and that I have to keep upstairs.\"\\n\\nHis ridiculous modesty--Jack\\'s modesty about his pictures? My\\n\\ncuriosity was growing like the bean-stalk. I said persuasively\\n\\nto my hostess: \"I must really see your portrait, you know.\"\\n\\nShe glanced out almost timorously at the terrace where her\\n\\nhusband, lounging in a hooded chair, had lit a cigar and drawn\\n\\nthe Russian deerhound\\'s head between his knees.\\n\\n\"Well, come while he\\'s not looking,\" she said, with a laugh that\\n\\ntried to hide her nervousness; and I followed her between the\\n\\nmarble Emperors of the hall, and up the wide stairs with terra-\\n\\ncotta nymphs poised among flowers at each landing.\\n\\nIn the dimmest corner of her boudoir, amid a profusion of\\n\\ndelicate and distinguished objects, hung one of the familiar oval\\n\\ncanvases, in the inevitable garlanded frame. The mere outline of\\n\\nthe frame called up all Gisburn\\'s past!\\n\\nMrs. Gisburn drew back the window-curtains, moved aside a\\n\\njardiniere full of pink azaleas, pushed an arm-chair away, and\\n\\nsaid: \"If you stand here you can just manage to see it. I had it\\n\\nover the mantel-piece, but he wouldn\\'t let it stay.\"\\n\\nYes--I could just manage to see it--the first portrait of Jack\\'s\\n\\nI had ever had to strain my eyes over! Usually they had the\\n\\nplace of honour--say the central panel in a pale yellow or rose\\n\\nDubarry drawing-room, or a monumental easel placed so that it\\n\\ntook the light through curtains of old Venetian point. The more\\n\\nmodest place became the picture better; yet, as my eyes grew\\n\\naccustomed to the half-light, all the characteristic qualities\\n\\ncame out--all the hesitations disguised as audacities, the tricks\\n\\nof prestidigitation by which, with such consummate skill, he\\n\\nmanaged to divert attention from the real business of the picture\\n\\nto some pretty irrelevance of detail. Mrs. Gisburn, presenting a\\n\\nneutral surface to work on--forming, as it were, so inevitably\\n\\nthe background of her own picture--had lent herself in an unusual\\n\\ndegree to the display of this false virtuosity. The picture was\\n\\none of Jack\\'s \"strongest,\" as his admirers would have put it--it\\n\\nrepresented, on his part, a swelling of muscles, a congesting of\\n\\nveins, a balancing, straddling and straining, that reminded one\\n\\nof the circus-clown\\'s ironic efforts to lift a feather. It met,\\n\\nin short, at every point the demand of lovely woman to be painted\\n\\n\"strongly\" because she was tired of being painted \"sweetly\"--and\\n\\nyet not to lose an atom of the sweetness.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the last he painted, you know,\" Mrs. Gisburn said with\\n\\npardonable pride. \"The last but one,\" she corrected herself--\\n\\n\"but the other doesn\\'t count, because he destroyed it.\"\\n\\n\"Destroyed it?\" I was about to follow up this clue when I heard\\n\\na footstep and saw Jack himself on the threshold.\\n\\nAs he stood there, his hands in the pockets of his velveteen\\n\\ncoat, the thin brown waves of hair pushed back from his white\\n\\nforehead, his lean sunburnt cheeks furrowed by a smile that\\n\\nlifted the tips of a self-confident moustache, I felt to what a\\n\\ndegree he had the same quality as his pictures--the quality of\\n\\nlooking cleverer than he was.\\n\\nHis wife glanced at him deprecatingly, but his eyes travelled\\n\\npast her to the portrait.\\n\\n\"Mr. Rickham wanted to see it,\" she began, as if excusing\\n\\nherself. He shrugged his shoulders, still smiling.\\n\\n\"Oh, Rickham found me out long ago,\" he said lightly; then,\\n\\npassing his arm through mine: \"Come and see the rest of the\\n\\nhouse.\"\\n\\nHe showed it to me with a kind of naive suburban pride: the\\n\\nbath-rooms, the speaking-tubes, the dress-closets, the trouser-\\n\\npresses--all the complex simplifications of the millionaire\\'s\\n\\ndomestic economy. And whenever my wonder paid the expected\\n\\ntribute he said, throwing out his chest a little: \"Yes, I really\\n\\ndon\\'t see how people manage to live without that.\"\\n\\nWell--it was just the end one might have foreseen for him. Only\\n\\nhe was, through it all and in spite of it all--as he had been\\n\\nthrough, and in spite of, his pictures--so handsome, so charming,\\n\\nso disarming, that one longed to cry out: \"Be dissatisfied with\\n\\nyour leisure!\" as once one had longed to say: \"Be dissatisfied\\n\\nwith your work!\"\\n\\nBut, with the cry on my lips, my diagnosis suffered an unexpected\\n\\ncheck.\\n\\n\"This is my own lair,\" he said, leading me into a dark plain room\\n\\nat the end of the florid vista. It was square and brown and\\n\\nleathery: no \"effects\"; no bric-a-brac, none of the air of posing\\n\\nfor reproduction in a picture weekly--above all, no least sign of\\n\\never having been used as a studio.\\n\\nThe fact brought home to me the absolute finality of Jack\\'s break\\n\\nwith his old life.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you ever dabble with paint any more?\" I asked, still\\n\\nlooking about for a trace of such activity.\\n\\n\"Never,\" he said briefly.\\n\\n\"Or water-colour--or etching?\"\\n\\nHis confident eyes grew dim, and his cheeks paled a little under\\n\\ntheir handsome sunburn.\\n\\n\"Never think of it, my dear fellow--any more than if I\\'d never\\n\\ntouched a brush.\"\\n\\nAnd his tone told me in a flash that he never thought of anything\\n\\nelse.\\n\\nI moved away, instinctively embarrassed by my unexpected\\n\\ndiscovery; and as I turned, my eye fell on a small picture above\\n\\nthe mantel-piece--the only object breaking the plain oak\\n\\npanelling of the room.\\n\\n\"Oh, by Jove!\" I said.\\n\\nIt was a sketch of a donkey--an old tired donkey, standing in the\\n\\nrain under a wall.\\n\\n\"By Jove--a Stroud!\" I cried.\\n\\nHe was silent; but I felt him close behind me, breathing a little\\n\\nquickly.\\n\\n\"What a wonder! Made with a dozen lines--but on everlasting\\n\\nfoundations. You lucky chap, where did you get it?\"\\n\\nHe answered slowly: \"Mrs. Stroud gave it to me.\"\\n\\n\"Ah--I didn\\'t know you even knew the Strouds. He was such an\\n\\ninflexible hermit.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t--till after. . . . She sent for me to paint him when\\n\\nhe was dead.\"\\n\\n\"When he was dead? You?\"\\n\\nI must have let a little too much amazement escape through my\\n\\nsurprise, for he answered with a deprecating laugh: \"Yes--she\\'s\\n\\nan awful simpleton, you know, Mrs. Stroud. Her only idea was to\\n\\nhave him done by a fashionable painter--ah, poor Stroud! She\\n\\nthought it the surest way of proclaiming his greatness--of\\n\\nforcing it on a purblind public. And at the moment I was THE\\n\\nfashionable painter.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, poor Stroud--as you say. Was THAT his history?\"\\n\\n\"That was his history. She believed in him, gloried in him--or\\n\\nthought she did. But she couldn\\'t bear not to have all the\\n\\ndrawing-rooms with her. She couldn\\'t bear the fact that, on\\n\\nvarnishing days, one could always get near enough to see his\\n\\npictures. Poor woman! She\\'s just a fragment groping for other\\n\\nfragments. Stroud is the only whole I ever knew.\"\\n\\n\"You ever knew? But you just said--\"\\n\\nGisburn had a curious smile in his eyes.\\n\\n\"Oh, I knew him, and he knew me--only it happened after he was\\n\\ndead.\"\\n\\nI dropped my voice instinctively. \"When she sent for you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--quite insensible to the irony. She wanted him vindicated--\\n\\nand by me!\"\\n\\nHe laughed again, and threw back his head to look up at the\\n\\nsketch of the donkey. \"There were days when I couldn\\'t look at\\n\\nthat thing--couldn\\'t face it. But I forced myself to put it\\n\\nhere; and now it\\'s cured me--cured me. That\\'s the reason why I\\n\\ndon\\'t dabble any more, my dear Rickham; or rather Stroud himself\\n\\nis the reason.\"\\n\\nFor the first time my idle curiosity about my companion turned\\n\\ninto a serious desire to understand him better.\\n\\n\"I wish you\\'d tell me how it happened,\" I said.\\n\\nHe stood looking up at the sketch, and twirling between his\\n\\nfingers a cigarette he had forgotten to light. Suddenly he\\n\\nturned toward me.\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather like to tell you--because I\\'ve always suspected you\\n\\nof loathing my work.\"\\n\\nI made a deprecating gesture, which he negatived with a good-\\n\\nhumoured shrug.\\n\\n\"Oh, I didn\\'t care a straw when I believed in myself--and now\\n\\nit\\'s an added tie between us!\"\\n\\nHe laughed slightly, without bitterness, and pushed one of the\\n\\ndeep arm-chairs forward. \"There: make yourself comfortable--and\\n\\nhere are the cigars you like.\"\\n\\nHe placed them at my elbow and continued to wander up and down\\n\\nthe room, stopping now and then beneath the picture.\\n\\n\"How it happened? I can tell you in five minutes--and it didn\\'t\\n\\ntake much longer to happen. . . . I can remember now how\\n\\nsurprised and pleased I was when I got Mrs. Stroud\\'s note. Of\\n\\ncourse, deep down, I had always FELT there was no one like him--\\n\\nonly I had gone with the stream, echoed the usual platitudes\\n\\nabout him, till I half got to think he was a failure, one of the\\n\\nkind that are left behind. By Jove, and he WAS left behind--\\n\\nbecause he had come to stay! The rest of us had to let ourselves\\n\\nbe swept along or go under, but he was high above the current--on\\n\\neverlasting foundations, as you say.\\n\\n\"Well, I went off to the house in my most egregious mood--rather\\n\\nmoved, Lord forgive me, at the pathos of poor Stroud\\'s career of\\n\\nfailure being crowned by the glory of my painting him! Of course\\n\\nI meant to do the picture for nothing--I told Mrs. Stroud so when\\n\\nshe began to stammer something about her poverty. I remember\\n\\ngetting off a prodigious phrase about the honour being MINE--oh,\\n\\nI was princely, my dear Rickham! I was posing to myself like one\\n\\nof my own sitters.\\n\\n\"Then I was taken up and left alone with him. I had sent all my\\n\\ntraps in advance, and I had only to set up the easel and get to\\n\\nwork. He had been dead only twenty-four hours, and he died\\n\\nsuddenly, of heart disease, so that there had been no preliminary\\n\\nwork of destruction--his face was clear and untouched. I had met\\n\\nhim once or twice, years before, and thought him insignificant\\n\\nand dingy. Now I saw that he was superb.\\n\\n\"I was glad at first, with a merely aesthetic satisfaction: glad\\n\\nto have my hand on such a \\'subject.\\' Then his strange life-\\n\\nlikeness began to affect me queerly--as I blocked the head in I\\n\\nfelt as if he were watching me do it. The sensation was followed\\n\\nby the thought: if he WERE watching me, what would he say to my\\n\\nway of working? My strokes began to go a little wild--I felt\\n\\nnervous and uncertain.\\n\\n\"Once, when I looked up, I seemed to see a smile behind his close\\n\\ngrayish beard--as if he had the secret, and were amusing himself\\n\\nby holding it back from me. That exasperated me still more. The\\n\\nsecret? Why, I had a secret worth twenty of his! I dashed at\\n\\nthe canvas furiously, and tried some of my bravura tricks. But\\n\\nthey failed me, they crumbled. I saw that he wasn\\'t watching the\\n\\nshowy bits--I couldn\\'t distract his attention; he just kept his\\n\\neyes on the hard passages between. Those were the ones I had\\n\\nalways shirked, or covered up with some lying paint. And how he\\n\\nsaw through my lies!\\n\\n\"I looked up again, and caught sight of that sketch of the donkey\\n\\nhanging on the wall near his bed. His wife told me afterward it\\n\\nwas the last thing he had done--just a note taken with a shaking\\n\\nhand, when he was down in Devonshire recovering from a previous\\n\\nheart attack. Just a note! But it tells his whole history.\\n\\nThere are years of patient scornful persistence in every line. A\\n\\nman who had swum with the current could never have learned that\\n\\nmighty up-stream stroke. . . .\\n\\n\"I turned back to my work, and went on groping and muddling; then\\n\\nI looked at the donkey again. I saw that, when Stroud laid in\\n\\nthe first stroke, he knew just what the end would be. He had\\n\\npossessed his subject, absorbed it, recreated it. When had I\\n\\ndone that with any of my things? They hadn\\'t been born of me--I\\n\\nhad just adopted them. . . .\\n\\n\"Hang it, Rickham, with that face watching me I couldn\\'t do\\n\\nanother stroke. The plain truth was, I didn\\'t know where to put\\n\\nit--I HAD NEVER KNOWN. Only, with my sitters and my public, a\\n\\nshowy splash of colour covered up the fact--I just threw paint\\n\\ninto their faces. . . . Well, paint was the one medium those\\n\\ndead eyes could see through--see straight to the tottering\\n\\nfoundations underneath. Don\\'t you know how, in talking a foreign\\n\\nlanguage, even fluently, one says half the time not what one\\n\\nwants to but what one can? Well--that was the way I painted; and\\n\\nas he lay there and watched me, the thing they called my\\n\\n\\'technique\\' collapsed like a house of cards. He didn\\'t sneer,\\n\\nyou understand, poor Stroud--he just lay there quietly watching,\\n\\nand on his lips, through the gray beard, I seemed to hear the\\n\\nquestion: \\'Are you sure you know where you\\'re coming out?\\'\\n\\n\"If I could have painted that face, with that question on it, I\\n\\nshould have done a great thing. The next greatest thing was to\\n\\nsee that I couldn\\'t--and that grace was given me. But, oh, at\\n\\nthat minute, Rickham, was there anything on earth I wouldn\\'t have\\n\\ngiven to have Stroud alive before me, and to hear him say: \\'It\\'s\\n\\nnot too late--I\\'ll show you how\\'?\\n\\n\"It WAS too late--it would have been, even if he\\'d been alive. I\\n\\npacked up my traps, and went down and told Mrs. Stroud. Of\\n\\ncourse I didn\\'t tell her THAT--it would have been Greek to her.\\n\\nI simply said I couldn\\'t paint him, that I was too moved. She\\n\\nrather liked the idea--she\\'s so romantic! It was that that made\\n\\nher give me the donkey. But she was terribly upset at not\\n\\ngetting the portrait--she did so want him \\'done\\' by some one\\n\\nshowy! At first I was afraid she wouldn\\'t let me off--and at my\\n\\nwits\\' end I suggested Grindle. Yes, it was I who started\\n\\nGrindle: I told Mrs. Stroud he was the \\'coming\\' man, and she told\\n\\nsomebody else, and so it got to be true. . . . And he painted\\n\\nStroud without wincing; and she hung the picture among her\\n\\nhusband\\'s things. . . .\"\\n\\nHe flung himself down in the arm-chair near mine, laid back his\\n\\nhead, and clasping his arms beneath it, looked up at the picture\\n\\nabove the chimney-piece.\\n\\n\"I like to fancy that Stroud himself would have given it to me,\\n\\nif he\\'d been able to say what he thought that day.\"\\n\\nAnd, in answer to a question I put half-mechanically--\"Begin\\n\\nagain?\" he flashed out. \"When the one thing that brings me\\n\\nanywhere near him is that I knew enough to leave off?\"\\n\\nHe stood up and laid his hand on my shoulder with a laugh. \"Only\\n\\nthe irony of it is that I AM still painting--since Grindle\\'s\\n\\ndoing it for me! The Strouds stand alone, and happen once--but\\n\\nthere\\'s no exterminating our kind of art.\"\\n\\nThe End of The Verdict'"
